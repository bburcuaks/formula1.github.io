<h4> Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
<h5>Why do Formula 1 drivers experience weight and fluid loss during races?</h5>
<p>
  During races lasting approximately one and a half to two hours, drivers are exposed to significant amounts of heat and humidity. 
  Therefore, weight and fluid loss is experienced throughout the race, which amounts to around 2 to 3 kilograms of loss.That's why they drink plenty of water before the race starts.

<h5>Do Formula 1 drivers train a lot?</h5>
<p>
    Even though Formula 1 drivers might appear to be just driving cars, they are actually among the athletes who experience the most training in the world.
  Because of the downforce of the cars, the pilots are exposed to 5G force. Strength and durability are key to F1 . Therefore pilots are tested frequently and always train to stay at a certain weight and muscle level.

<h5>Is Formula 1 really the fastest car in the world?</h5>
<p>Not.The fact that these vehicles are not the fastest cars has two simple reasons.The first of these is that the primary purpose of Formula 1 cars is to be designed for setting the fastest lap times on tracks, not to reach the highest speeds.
  "In Formula 1, the cornering speeds of cars and how quickly they can accelerate after these corners are more important than being fast.
  The second reason is the fact that Formula 1 cars are constructed under specific regulations.The engine of a Formula 1 car is approximately 1000 hpThe car can reach a speed of 345 km / h per hour.

<h5>Is Formula 1 a dangerous sport?</h5>
<p>
  
Even though Formula 1 has advanced technology and high-level safety systems, there is still a risk of accidents. Throughout F1 history, many drivers have been involved in accidents, and some of them even lost their lives.

What are the worst accidents in the history of Formula 1?

</p>
<h6>1994 San Marino Grand Prix – Ayrton Senna</h6>

<h6>2020 Bahreyn Grand Prix – Romain Grosjean</h6>
<p>
  During the 2020 Bahrain Grand Prix, Romain Grosjean crashed into the barriers with a strong impact. As the car burst into flames, the pilot's survival seemed like a miracle. What saved the driver's life was the safety system called 'Halo'. This system protects the driver's head during the moment of impact and enables them to exit the cockpit.</p>

    <h5>What is the life-saving Halo?</h5>
    <p>The Halo system is a collision protection system consisting of a curved bar installed to protect the driver's head
      Halo became mandatory in races by the FIA starting from 2018.
      The coma and subsequent death of Jules Bianchi in Formula 1's last fatal accident in 2014 played a significant role in making the Halo mandatory.
